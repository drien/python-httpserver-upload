# Python http.server File Upload

This repo contains a simple file upload page that works with the Python standard library http.server module, using CGI. No modules or installations required.

Just place the cgi-bin folder from this repo in a directory, then run the http.server command with the `--cgi` flag from that directory, and visit http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/pyupload.cgi

`python3 -m http.server --cgi`

If you have the `qrcode` Python library installed it will render a QR code using your machine's .local address to make it simpler to access from other devices.

### Why?!??

Who doesn't want to write cgi scripts in 2023? Kids these days have no idea how the world used to work.

But actuallyâ€“the http.server module is really handy and very widely available. Sometimes you just want to drop some files to another machine.

### It doesn't work

Ensure your user has execute permissions on the cgi file.

Try: `chmod +x ./cgi-bin/pyupload.cgi`
